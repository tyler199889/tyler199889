            <h1>This page has information and updates for competitions :)</h1>
            <p>Our first competition is going to be most likely in Decemeber. All groups need to 
                have a robot done by December first so we can start testing all a y'alls bots 
                and use the field to practice for competition. In the past there have been two dates 
                for regionals and we can go to both. Win one and you go to state, win both and you knock out 
                competition. If you win your team advances but not the rest of the school groups.
                Regional-state-national-(world?). If you make state you get a letterman.
                The team that wins state goes to nationals. We had a team do this two years ago but they 
                never got to go to the national competition because of rona which shouldn't be an issue this 
                year.
